Unable to land, after more than an hour the pilot was forced to land the helicopter close to a highway carpark near Hélécine, 40\\xa0km east of Brussels. The three hijackers escaped, while the pilot afterwards flew the helicopter to the base of the Federal Police Air Support Detachment.[71] Four people were arrested two days later in connection with the hijacking.[72] Mike G., aged 24 from Tongeren, a convicted drug dealer released from jail but still under electronic surveillance, was arrested under the suspicion of having organised the failed prison break of his wife Kristel A., aged 27, who is awaiting trial for murder.[73]\"]]\n"

Joel's sister, Judy Kaplan, arranged the means to help Kaplan escape, and on the aforementioned date, a helicopter landed in the prison yard. The guards mistakenly thought this was an official visit. In two minutes, Kaplan and his cellmate Contreras, a Venezuelan counterfeiter, were able to board the craft and were piloted away, before any shots were fired.[10] Both men were flown to Texas and then different planes flew Kaplan to California and Contreras to Guatemala.[3] The Mexican government never initiated extradition proceedings against Kaplan.[10] The escape is told in a book, The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan.[5] It also inspired the 1975 action movie Breakout, which starred Charles Bronson and Robert Duvall.[10]\"]\n",
